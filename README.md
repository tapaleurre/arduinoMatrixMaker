# arduinoMatrixMaker
My project for drawing on splatoon

The project will provide a gui where you can select a picture and it will be converted to an arduino program, hook the right ports to your controller buttons and let the magic happen.
I will optimize it to work with soldering the pins to a controller buttons. If you use something else like motors, be sure to ajust the timing between each presses.
See howto.pdf for a detailed tutorial.
